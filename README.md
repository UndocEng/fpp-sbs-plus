# ChatGPT FPP Listener

A **show-owner developer tool** for Falcon Player (FPP). Lets visitors listen to your show audio on their phones, synced to your light show. Gives the show owner full control: start/stop sequences and playlists, manage the WiFi access point, all from one page.

---

## What This Does

1. Creates a dedicated WiFi hotspot (called **SHOW_AUDIO**) using a USB WiFi adapter
2. When visitors connect to that hotspot and open any webpage, they get redirected to a **listen page**
3. The listen page downloads the current show audio and keeps it synced to whatever FPP is playing
4. The show owner can start/stop playlists and sequences right from that same page
5. The show owner can change the WiFi password from the page (under Options)

---

## Important: Must Be Installed on the Master

This must be installed on your **master** FPP (the one in **player mode**), not on a remote. It needs:

- Direct access to the music files in `/home/fpp/media/music/`
- The FPP API at `127.0.0.1` to read playback status and start/stop playlists
- Remotes don't store media locally — they only receive channel data from the master

If your master controls the show, that's where this goes.

## What You Need

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A **Raspberry Pi** running **Falcon Player (FPP) in player (master) mode** — any version that uses `/opt/fpp/www/` as its web root (FPP 6+)
- A **USB WiFi adapter** that supports AP (access point) mode — most cheap USB adapters work. It needs to show up as `wlan1` when you plug it in
- Your FPP already has **sequences (.fseq files)** and matching **audio files (.mp3)** loaded
- A computer on the same network as your FPP to run the install commands
- Basic ability to type commands into a terminal (we'll walk you through every step)

---

## Step-by-Step Install

### Step 1: Plug in the USB WiFi adapter

Plug your USB WiFi adapter into one of the Pi's USB ports. It doesn't matter which one.

### Step 2: Open a terminal to your FPP

You need to get a command line on your FPP. Pick one of these methods:

**Option A — SSH from your computer:**
- **Windows:** Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and type:
  ```
  ssh fpp@YOUR_FPP_IP
  ```
  Replace `YOUR_FPP_IP` with your FPP's IP address (for example `10.1.66.204`).
  When it asks for a password, type `falcon` and press Enter.

- **Mac/Linux:** Open Terminal and type the same command above.

**Option B — Use the FPP web interface:**
- Open your browser and go to `http://YOUR_FPP_IP/`
- Click on **Content Setup** in the menu
- Click **File Manager**
- (This method only works for uploading files — you'll still need SSH for the install command)

### Step 3: Download this project onto your FPP

Once you're logged in via SSH, type these commands one at a time (press Enter after each one):

```bash
cd /home/fpp
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TNash-FPP/ChatGPT-fpp-listen.git
```

```bash
cd ChatGPT-fpp-listen
```

### Step 4: Run the installer

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

You should see output like this:
```
=========================================
  ChatGPT FPP Listener - v1.0
=========================================

[install] Web root: /opt/fpp/www
[install] Deploying web files...
[install] Web files deployed
[install] Created /music symlink
[install] Setting up listener config...
[install] Default WiFi password: Listen123

=========================================
  Install complete!
=========================================
  Page:     http://192.168.50.1/listen/
  WiFi:     SHOW_AUDIO (WPA2)
  Password: Listen123 (change via web UI)
=========================================
```

### Step 5: Start the WiFi hotspot

```bash
sudo systemctl start listener-ap
```

This turns on the WiFi hotspot. It will also start automatically every time the Pi boots.

### Step 6: Test it

1. On your phone, look for a WiFi network called **SHOW_AUDIO**
2. Connect to it using password **Listen123**
3. Open your phone's browser and go to `http://192.168.50.1/listen/`
4. You should see the Show Audio page with a Playback section at the top
5. Select a sequence from the dropdown and tap **Start** — your lights and audio should begin

That's it! You're done.

---

## How to Use It

### Starting a show

1. Open the listen page (either from the SHOW_AUDIO WiFi at `http://192.168.50.1/listen/` or from your main network at `http://YOUR_FPP_IP/listen/`)
2. Pick a playlist or sequence from the dropdown
3. Tap **Start**
4. Audio will play through the phone speaker and lights will run on your display

### Stopping a show

Tap the **Stop** button.

### Listening (for visitors)

Tell your visitors to:
1. Connect to the **SHOW_AUDIO** WiFi (give them the password)
2. Open any webpage — they'll be redirected to the listen page
3. Tap anywhere on the page to enable audio
4. Keep the page open during the show

### Changing the WiFi password

1. On the listen page, scroll down and tap **Options**
2. Type a new password (must be 8-63 characters)
3. Tap **Change Password**
4. The WiFi hotspot will restart — everyone will need to reconnect with the new password

### Accessing from your main network

The listen page works on both networks:
- **WiFi hotspot:** `http://192.168.50.1/listen/`
- **Main network:** `http://YOUR_FPP_IP/listen/`

This is a developer tool, so there's no login required on your main network. The only security is the WPA2 password on the WiFi hotspot (wlan1).

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't see the SHOW_AUDIO WiFi network"

- Make sure your USB WiFi adapter is plugged in
- Check if it's recognized: `ip link show wlan1` — you should see it listed
- Make sure the service is running: `sudo systemctl status listener-ap`
- Restart it: `sudo systemctl restart listener-ap`
- Check the log: `journalctl -u listener-ap -n 30`

### "The page loads but I hear no audio"

- On iPhone, check that the **ringer switch** (on the side of the phone) is not on silent
- Turn up the **volume** on the phone
- Tap anywhere on the page — mobile browsers require a tap before they'll play audio
- Check that you have `.mp3` files in `/home/fpp/media/music/` with the same name as your `.fseq` files (e.g. `Elvis.fseq` needs `Elvis.mp3`)

### "The sequence starts but the lights don't do anything"

This is an FPP output configuration issue, not a listener issue. Check:
- Go to your FPP web interface (`http://YOUR_FPP_IP/`)
- Click **Input/Output Setup** > **Channel Outputs**
- Make sure your output universes are **active** (checkbox enabled)
- Make sure the output IP addresses are correct (not your FPP's own IP)
- If you see a warning like "UDP Output set to send data to myself" — that means one of your outputs is pointed at the FPP itself. Change it to the correct controller IP

### "Audio is out of sync"

- Tap the **Resync** button on the listen page
- If it's consistently off, check that your Pi has the correct time (FPP usually handles this automatically)

### "I can't connect to the WiFi anymore after changing the password"

- The default password is `Listen123`
- If you forgot your new password, SSH into the FPP and check: `cat /home/fpp/listen-sync/hostapd-listener.conf | grep wpa_passphrase`
- To reset to default, edit the file: `sudo nano /home/fpp/listen-sync/hostapd-listener.conf`, change `wpa_passphrase=` to `Listen123`, save, then restart: `sudo systemctl restart listener-ap`

---

## Updating

To get the latest version:

```bash
cd /home/fpp/ChatGPT-fpp-listen
git pull
sudo ./install.sh
```

Your WiFi password and settings will be preserved (the installer doesn't overwrite existing config).

---

## Uninstall

To completely remove everything this project installed:

```bash
cd /home/fpp/ChatGPT-fpp-listen
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

This removes:
- All web files from `/opt/fpp/www/listen/`
- The `/music` symlink
- The `listener-ap` systemd service (stopped and disabled)
- The sudoers entry for the web UI
- The config directory at `/home/fpp/listen-sync/`
- Any running hostapd/dnsmasq processes started by the listener

After uninstalling, your FPP is exactly as it was before you installed this project. You can then delete the project folder:

```bash
rm -rf /home/fpp/ChatGPT-fpp-listen
```

## Technical Details (for developers)

- Audio sync uses 250ms polling of FPP's `/api/fppd/status` endpoint
- Clock offset between phone and server is estimated using request midpoint timing
- Hard seek when error exceeds 1 second, with 2-second cooldown between seeks
- FPP only provides whole-second precision for `seconds_played`, so sub-second error is expected
- Playback starts via `POST /api/command` with the "Start Playlist" command (works for both playlists and `.fseq` sequences)
- The WiFi AP runs hostapd on wlan1 with dnsmasq for DHCP and DNS (all queries resolve to the AP IP for captive portal behavior)
- Config is stored at `/home/fpp/listen-sync/hostapd-listener.conf` and persists across reboots
- The web UI uses sudo via `/etc/sudoers.d/listener-sync` to write the hostapd config and restart the AP service
