FPP WebSocket Sync Beacon
=========================

This is the server-side component of the FPP Eavesdrop sync system. It runs as
a systemd service (ws-sync.service) on the Raspberry Pi and does three things:

1. POLLS THE FPP API every 100ms to get the current playback state (playing/
   stopped/paused, which track, position in milliseconds, etc.).

2. BROADCASTS that state to all connected WebSocket clients (phones). This is
   how phones know where FPP is in the current song. The WebSocket is proxied
   through Apache on port 80 (path /ws) -> this server on port 8080.

3. HANDLES CLIENT MESSAGES:
   - "ping": Echoes back with server timestamp for NTP-style clock offset
     estimation. The client measures RTT and computes the offset between
     its clock and the Pi's clock.
   - "report": Client sync telemetry (error, rate, etc.) logged to a file
     for debugging. Only sent when the user enables "Server Log" checkbox.

Architecture:
  Client phone <-> Apache (port 80, /ws proxy) <-> This server (port 8080)
  This server -> FPP API (http://127.0.0.1/api/fppd/status)

The server is stateless except for caching the last FPP state (so new clients
get immediate state on connect) and the set of connected clients.

Dependencies:
  - Python 3 with asyncio
  - websockets package (installed via apt: python3-websockets)
  - FPP running on the same Pi (provides the HTTP API)
